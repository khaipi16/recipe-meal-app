Context API
-setting up all the logic in one place and cherrypick data that is needed



once project gets big and complex, will face limiations that
- less structure than redux/redux-toolkit
- clunky communicating between mulitple context api's 


useEffect()
- is a hook to fetch data

- invoke the hook function and pass in the callback function
and the callback function (whatever is in there) will be invoked after every render

-cannot turn into async
